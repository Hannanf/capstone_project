# Life Insurance Analysis Project


Life insurance is a valuable tool for Canadians to protect themselves from financial difficulties in the case of an unfortunate event, but many people are turned away from the cost. It would be beneficial to understand the components making up life insurance premiums, and help people plan the purchases.


## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on different demographic data to determine the cost of life insurance. This would be an insightful project for both insurance companies and people who are looking to plan their insurances.


## Process

**Initial Phase - Data Preparation**
* The data was collected from Stats Canada and Kaggle. We collected demographic data including age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoker, and charges. As well as average income data from Stats Canada.

**Second Phase - Data Processing**
* We will be consolidating the data into a SQL databse, and connect to a Machine learning model to apply supervised machine learning to determine correlations in determining cost of life insurance.

**Final Phase - Data Presentation**
* The analysis will be transformed into a webpage for visualization, a slide will be provided for final presentation.


## Technology

* Data is collected and preprocessed in Python - Jupyter Notebook, using Pandas
* Preprocessed data is imported into Postgres using pgAdmin
* The databse will then connect to Machine Learning model, and will be processed using Jupyter Notebook
* The data visualization will be presented in a webpage that is coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript; the presentation slides will be created using Google slides
